    <h1><i>The White Lotus</i></h1>
         <p><b><i>The White Lotus</i></b> is an American dark comedy drama anthology television series created by Mike White for HBO that premiered on July 11, 2021. The series follows the exploits of the guests and staff during a week spent at a fictional luxury global resort hotel chain called "The White Lotus".[4] The first season was filmed and set in Hawaii, the second in Sicily, and the third in Thailand.

The White Lotus was greenlit in October 2020 as a miniseries but was adapted to an anthology series by HBO in August 2021: its second season aired from October 30 to December 11, 2022, and its third season from February 16 until April 6, 2025, being delayed by the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike. The series has been renewed for a fourth season. It is available on Max at the same time as the linear broadcast.

The series has been acclaimed by critics for its writing, acting, humor, and production values and has received several accolades: it has won fifteen Primetime Emmy Awards – including for Outstanding Limited or Anthology Series – and two Golden Globes, including for Best Limited or Anthology Series or Television Film. Jennifer Coolidge won several awards for her performance in the first two seasons, including two Primetime Emmys and a Golden Globe, Murray Bartlett also won an Emmy for his performance in the first season while White won three Emmys for his writing, directing and producing.</p>
    
    <h2><b>Synopsis</b></h2>
             <p>Each season is set at a different White Lotus resort hotel, and is mostly self-contained, with some characters returning. Each season tells the story of the guests and staff during a week spent at the White Lotus, whose interactions are affected by their various psychosocial dysfunctions. After each passing day, a darker complexity slowly emerges in the hotel's employees, their wealthy guests, and the idyllic locale itself</p>
